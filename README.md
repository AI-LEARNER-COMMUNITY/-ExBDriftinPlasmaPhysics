# ExBDriftinPlasmaPhysics
The positive and negative particles drift in a direction perpendicular to the electric and magnetic field directions! This is called E-cross-B drift, sometimes written ExB drift from the mathematical notation.To understand why this is, consider just the motion of the positive particle.
